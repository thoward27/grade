Command-Line Interface
================================

Grade is executable as a module, similarly to `coverage`.

You can control what gets executed, and how it gets reported quite easily:

.. code:: bash

    python -m grade run
    python -m grade report gradescope

For full details on the command line interface, run `python -m grade --help`
